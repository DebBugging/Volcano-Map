### Contributing

I had a hardtime figuring out how to use SCSS along with create-react-app and found some great resources that helped me figure it out:
- [Using Sass with Create React App V1 (Without Ejecting)](https://hackernoon.com/using-sass-with-create-react-app-without-ejecting-b5f4f827ed9e) by Jeff Duke.
- [Using Sass in a React app development](https://dev.to/koheishingaihq/react-with-sass-11e) by koheishingai. 

I received a lot of pointers from [Forrest Walker](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4rQq4MQP1crXuPtruu_eijgOUUXhcUCP).

I also received help from my fantastic peers who are taking
this Udacity Nano-Degree alongside me.

#### Enjoy!
