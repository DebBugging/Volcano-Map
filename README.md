# Volcano-Map (Project 7)

---

### Project Overview

This is the final project for the Udacity Front-End NanoDegree. I created a React.js Map Application that filters through the volcanoes of Central Costa Rica using Google Maps API and other third party APIs. This application is responsive and accessible. 

The Udacity [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1351/view) has a list of all the minimium requirements to complete the project.

## Instructions

To visit website: http://volcanomap.surge.sh/

Or to use locally:

1. Clone or download the Repository.

2. In a terminal:

- Type `npm install`
- And then start with `npm start`


#### Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Dependencies

- [Google Maps JavaScript API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial)
The map used is from Google.

- [Foursquare API](https://developer.foursquare.com/) 
Ab API to retrieve data and images.

- [React-Google-Maps](https://tomchentw.github.io/react-google-maps/)
 A library for wrapping the Google Maps JavaScript API in react components.

### Contributing

I had a hardtime figuring out how to use SCSS along with create-react-app and found some great resources that helped me figure it out:
- [Using Sass with Create React App V1 (Without Ejecting)](https://hackernoon.com/using-sass-with-create-react-app-without-ejecting-b5f4f827ed9e) by Jeff Duke.
- [Using Sass in a React app development](https://dev.to/koheishingaihq/react-with-sass-11e) by koheishingai. 


I received a lot of pointers from [Forrest Walker](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4rQq4MQP1crXuPtruu_eijgOUUXhcUCP).

I also received help from my fantastic peers who are taking
this Udacity Nano-Degree alongside me.

#### Enjoy!
